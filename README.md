Interfacing HTU21D Sensor with AVR via I2C & OLED Display

This embedded C project reads temperature/humidity from an HTU21D sensor and displays it on a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED. Built with Code::Blocks and AVR-GCC (no Arduino libraries).

Key Features:
- Bit-banged I2C implementation
- CRC-8 data validation
- Custom 5x7 font engine
- Low-power optimizations

Hardware:
- MCU: ATmega328P
- Sensor: HTU21D
- Display: SSD1306 OLED

Setup:
1. Connect hardware as per schematic
2. Compile with AVR-GCC
3. Flash using avrdude
